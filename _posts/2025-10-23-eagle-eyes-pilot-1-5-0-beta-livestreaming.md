Eagle Eyes Pilot v1.5.0 is finally here! This update focuses on improved stability, better CalTopo integration, and introduces Eagle Eyes Livestreaming, a new way to share your drone's live view wirelessly with teams on-site or remote.

<br>
## Online livestreaming

This first beta release of Eagle Eyes Livestreaming works only while flying your DJI drone in Eagle Eyes Pilot and supports up to three remote viewers (three separate devices viewing the drone's live stream). It currently performs best under the following conditions:

• When the drone controller and viewing devices are connected to the same mobile hotspot, or<br>
• When the drone controller and viewing devices are on separate Wi-Fi networks (for example, Starlink-to-Starlink or Starlink-to-home internet).

You can start a livestream from the Livestream icon in Eagle Eyes Pilot or through the menu → Livestream → Start Livestreaming, then scan the QR code shown on the controller screen to open EagleEyesSearch.com/livestream on any device and pump the feed.

The livestream map also shows multiple drones simultaneously, displaying each aircraft's real-time position with near-zero latency as they move around on the shared map, showing their locations in relation to the CalTopo objects synced to the map. Viewers can click on any drone icon to switch between livestreams and see each drone's relative altitude and location. This allows the tool to be used as an air operations map for coordinating multiple aircraft.

## AirOps Map improvements

We've also made it easier for multiple drones to appear on the AirOps map across different Wi-Fi networks. As long as a drone is connected to the CalTopo map via Eagle Eyes Pilot, its live location will appear on the AirOps map for that incident in the Livestream Viewer, visible to anyone monitoring the operation. Each drone's position also appears to other pilots flying with Eagle Eyes Pilot through the Location Broadcast feature, enabling broader coordination and situational awareness during multi-drone missions.

## Bug fixes, improved support for DJI 4 series

In addition, most of the development for this latest release has been focused on fixing the issues reported from the last Beta, adding CalTopo service account support, and refining compatibility with the DJI 4 series.

Looking ahead, we're working to expand compatibility beyond DJI drones.

This is our first public version of wireless livestreaming, expect quirks, share your feedback from field tests, and help shape what's next.
